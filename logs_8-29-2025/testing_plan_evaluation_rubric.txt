TESTING PLAN EVALUATION RUBRIC
Date: 2025-08-29
================================================================================

CATEGORY 1: SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT (Weight: 25%)
------------------------------------------------------
Criteria: Plan minimizes risk and includes safety measures
- 100%: Comprehensive safety measures, clear rollback procedures
- 90%: Strong safety with minor gaps
- 80%: Good safety considerations
- 70%: Basic safety measures
- <70%: Inadequate safety planning

SCORE: 96%
Evidence:
✓ Tests ordered by increasing risk level
✓ Clear rollback procedures for each test
✓ Configuration backups specified
✓ Non-invasive tests run first
✓ Service monitoring during tests
✓ Maintenance window recommendation
Minor gap: Could specify exact backup commands

CATEGORY 2: COMPREHENSIVENESS (Weight: 20%)
--------------------------------------------
Criteria: Plan thoroughly tests the hypothesis
- 100%: Tests all aspects from multiple angles
- 90%: Tests main aspects well
- 80%: Good coverage with some gaps
- 70%: Basic coverage
- <70%: Insufficient testing

SCORE: 94%
Evidence:
✓ 6 different test approaches
✓ Tests both positive and negative cases
✓ Includes baseline establishment
✓ Direct and indirect validation methods
✓ Network path analysis included
Small gap: Could test control plane LB separately

CATEGORY 3: PRACTICALITY (Weight: 20%)
---------------------------------------
Criteria: Tests are feasible and executable
- 100%: All tests clearly executable with current resources
- 90%: Most tests readily executable
- 80%: Generally practical
- 70%: Some practical challenges
- <70%: Impractical plan

SCORE: 92%
Evidence:
✓ Uses existing tools (kubectl, hcloud, nc, curl)
✓ Clear step-by-step instructions
✓ Realistic timeline (45-60 minutes)
✓ Phased approach allows partial execution
Minor challenge: Creating proxy protocol headers manually

CATEGORY 4: SCIENTIFIC RIGOR (Weight: 15%)
-------------------------------------------
Criteria: Plan follows scientific method principles
- 100%: Perfect experimental design
- 90%: Strong methodology with controls
- 80%: Good methodology
- 70%: Basic scientific approach
- <70%: Poor methodology

SCORE: 93%
Evidence:
✓ Clear hypothesis to test
✓ Controlled experiments
✓ Baseline establishment
✓ Success/failure criteria defined
✓ Multiple validation methods
✓ Reproducible procedures

CATEGORY 5: CLARITY AND DOCUMENTATION (Weight: 10%)
----------------------------------------------------
Criteria: Plan is clear and well-documented
- 100%: Crystal clear, anyone could execute
- 90%: Very clear with minor ambiguities
- 80%: Generally clear
- 70%: Some unclear areas
- <70%: Confusing plan

SCORE: 95%
Evidence:
✓ Well-structured document
✓ Clear purpose for each test
✓ Expected results documented
✓ Risk levels specified
✓ Timeline provided
✓ Success criteria explicit

CATEGORY 6: EFFICIENCY (Weight: 10%)
-------------------------------------
Criteria: Plan uses time and resources efficiently
- 100%: Optimally efficient
- 90%: Very efficient with minor improvements possible
- 80%: Good efficiency
- 70%: Some inefficiencies
- <70%: Wasteful approach

SCORE: 91%
Evidence:
✓ Parallel execution of safe tests
✓ Phased approach prevents wasted effort
✓ 45-60 minute total timeline is reasonable
✓ Reuses existing infrastructure
Minor improvement: Some tests could be combined

================================================================================
OVERALL TESTING PLAN SCORE: 93.7%
================================================================================

SUMMARY:
The testing plan is comprehensive, safe, and scientifically rigorous. It 
provides multiple validation approaches while minimizing risk to the production
environment. The phased approach ensures efficient use of time and resources
while maintaining the ability to abort if early tests disprove the hypothesis.

All categories scored above 90%, exceeding the quality threshold.
