# Deployment Failure: Missing KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION Secret

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Incident:** Production deployment failure  
**Status:** FIX IDENTIFIED - Action Required

## Executive Summary

Production deployment is failing because the required `KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION` secret has not been added to the GitHub repository. This is blocking all automatic deployments to the k3s cluster.

## Incident Details

### Timeline
- **14:52 CDT** - Deployment triggered by commit f228989a
- **14:52 CDT** - Build and test stages completed successfully  
- **14:52 CDT** - Production deployment failed at "Configure kubeconfig" step
- **15:05 CDT** - Root cause identified: missing GitHub secret
- **15:09 CDT** - Fix documented and ready for implementation

### Impact
- All production deployments blocked
- No service outage (existing deployment unaffected)
- Manual intervention required to resume CI/CD pipeline

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Symptom Observed**
   - Workflow run #17332938847 failed
   - Error at: Deploy to Production → Configure kubeconfig

2. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - H1: Missing secret (95% likelihood) - ✅ CONFIRMED
   - H2: Invalid base64 encoding (4% likelihood) - Not tested
   - H3: Invalid kubeconfig content (1% likelihood) - Not tested

3. **Evidence Found**
   ```bash
   echo "" | base64 -d > kubeconfig
   ```
   The logs show an empty string being decoded, confirming the secret is not set.

## Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Generate the Secret Value

Run this command on your local machine:

```bash
base64 -w0 /home/brian/Dev/consigliere-dev-pack/ai-consigliere-dev_kubeconfig.yaml
```

Copy the entire output (it will be a long string of characters).

### Step 2: Add Secret to GitHub

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/jakenelwood/espocrm-standalone/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name:** `KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION`
   - **Value:** [Paste the base64 string from Step 1]
4. Click **"Add secret"**

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After adding the secret, trigger a new deployment:

```bash
# Option 1: Manual trigger
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo jakenelwood/espocrm-standalone

# Option 2: Push a test commit
echo "# Deployment test $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify deployment with kubeconfig secret"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

```bash
# Watch the workflow
gh run watch --repo jakenelwood/espocrm-standalone

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n espocrm
kubectl get deployment/espocrm -n espocrm

# Verify application
curl -I https://quotennica.com
```

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Improvement

Add this check to the workflow to fail fast with a clear message:

```yaml
- name: Validate kubeconfig secret
  run: |
    if [ -z "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION }}" ]; then
      echo "❌ ERROR: KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION secret is not configured!"
      echo "Please add it at: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/settings/secrets/actions"
      echo "See docs/cicd-auto-deployment-setup.md for instructions"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "✅ KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION secret is configured"
```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Secret Validation Workflow** - Create a separate workflow to validate all required secrets
2. **Setup Script** - Provide a script to automate secret configuration
3. **Pre-flight Checks** - Add comprehensive validation before deployment attempts
4. **Documentation** - Mark required secrets more prominently in setup docs

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation vs Implementation** - Creating documentation doesn't ensure action items are completed
2. **Fail Fast** - Workflows should validate prerequisites early with clear error messages  
3. **Secret Management** - Consider using GitHub Environments for better secret organization
4. **Testing** - Always test the full deployment pipeline after configuration changes

## Action Items

- [ ] **IMMEDIATE**: Add KUBECONFIG_PRODUCTION secret (Instructions above)
- [ ] **TODAY**: Update workflow with better secret validation
- [ ] **THIS WEEK**: Create secret validation workflow
- [ ] **FUTURE**: Consider migrating to GitHub Environments for staging/production
